# Memento Protocol: High-Level Analysis & Improvement Suggestions

## Executive Summary

Memento Protocol is a meta-framework for Claude Code that aims to enhance AI understanding of projects through modes (AI personalities), workflows (procedures), and ticket-based state management. While the core architecture is solid, there are significant opportunities to improve usability, reduce friction, and enhance the value proposition for both users and LLMs.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths âœ…

1. **Clear Architecture**: The separation of modes, workflows, and tickets provides good conceptual organization
2. **Minimal Router Pattern**: CLAUDE.md stays lightweight by loading instructions on-demand
3. **State Persistence**: Ticket system allows work to continue across sessions
4. **Template System**: Good foundation of pre-built modes and workflows
5. **Meta-Development**: The project uses itself for development, proving viability

### Core Problems ðŸš¨

#### 1. **Ticket CLI Commands Are Not User-Friendly**
The ticket system feels more like database management than a productivity tool:

**Current Issues:**
- Too many manual steps: `create` â†’ `list` â†’ `resume` â†’ `move` â†’ `close`
- No intelligent defaults or automation
- CLI commands don't align with natural workflow
- Complex status management (next/in-progress/done) adds overhead
- No integration with actual development workflow

**User Perspective:** *"I just want to track my work, not manage a filing system"*

#### 2. **Mode/Workflow Discovery Gap**
Users struggle to know what's available and when to use it:

- No contextual suggestions based on current work
- Limited discoverability of relevant modes/workflows
- No guidance on when to switch modes
- Templates are generic, not project-specific

#### 3. **LLM Integration Friction**
The framework requires LLMs to remember and follow complex protocols:

- Manual mode activation required
- No automatic context switching
- Heavy reliance on LLM discipline to follow procedures
- Limited feedback mechanisms to ensure proper usage

## Specific Improvement Suggestions

### 1. **Redesign Ticket System** (High Priority)

#### Current Friction Points:
```bash
# Current: Too Many Steps
memento ticket create "fix auth bug"
memento ticket list
memento ticket resume fix-auth-bug-2025-01-13
# ... work happens ...
memento ticket move fix-auth-bug-2025-01-13 done
```

#### Proposed Smart Ticket System:
```bash
# Simplified workflow
memento work "fix auth bug"           # Auto-creates & activates
# ... work happens automatically tracked ...
memento done                          # Auto-closes current work

# Advanced options still available
memento work "feature X" --mode engineer
memento pause                         # Pauses current work
memento resume "auth"                 # Smart search & resume
memento status                        # Shows current work
```

#### Key Improvements:
- **Single Active Ticket**: Only one ticket can be "in-progress" at a time
- **Smart Defaults**: Auto-generate IDs, default descriptions
- **Git Integration**: Auto-commit progress, link to branches
- **Context Awareness**: Suggest relevant modes based on ticket type

### 2. **Intelligent Mode Switching**

#### Current Problem:
```markdown
User: "I need to review this code"
LLM: "Please specify which mode to use"
User: "act as reviewer"
LLM: *loads reviewer mode*
```

#### Proposed Auto-Detection:
```javascript
// Smart mode detection based on keywords/context
const INTENT_TO_MODE = {
  'review|audit|check': 'reviewer',
  'design|architect|plan': 'architect', 
  'implement|code|fix|debug': 'engineer',
  'refactor|cleanup|debt': 'ai-debt-maintainer'
}
```

#### Implementation:
- Add `--auto-mode` flag to init
- Include intent detection in CLAUDE.md template
- Provide mode switching suggestions in workflows

### 3. **Workflow Enhancement**

#### Current Workflows Need:
- **Contextual Triggers**: When to use each workflow
- **Better Integration**: Workflows should work together
- **Project Adaptation**: Customize workflows for specific tech stacks
- **Progress Tracking**: Built-in checkpoints and validation

#### Proposed Workflow Improvements:

**Smart Workflow Chaining:**
```markdown
# Example: Auto-chain related workflows
execute review â†’ suggests â†’ execute summarize
execute architect â†’ suggests â†’ create ticket
```

**Project-Specific Workflows:**
```bash
# Generate project-specific workflows
memento add workflow test --language typescript  # Tailored for TS
memento add workflow deploy --stack docker        # Docker-specific
```

### 4. **Enhanced CLI Experience**

#### Problems with Current CLI:
- Commands don't match mental models
- Too much ceremony for common tasks
- Limited help and guidance
- No interactive mode for complex operations

#### Proposed Improvements:

**Interactive Setup:**
```bash
memento setup --interactive
# Walks through project analysis
# Suggests relevant modes/workflows
# Sets up git hooks, editor integration
```

**Contextual Help:**
```bash
memento status                    # Shows current state + suggestions
memento suggest                   # Analyzes project, suggests actions
memento help --context           # Help based on current work
```

**Simplified Commands:**
```bash
# Current: Complex
memento ticket create "feature" --description "..."
memento ticket resume feature-2025-01-13

# Proposed: Simple
memento start "feature"          # Create & begin work
memento continue "feature"       # Resume (smart search)
memento finish                   # Complete current work
```

### 5. **LLM-Specific Improvements**

#### Current LLM Friction:
- Manual protocol adherence required
- No validation of proper workflow execution
- Limited context about project state
- Heavy cognitive load to remember all commands

#### Proposed LLM Enhancements:

**Auto-Status Reporting:**
```markdown
# LLM outputs at session start:
Mode: architect (auto-detected from task)
Active Ticket: auth-refactor-2025-01-13
Available Workflows: [review, summarize]
Next Suggested Action: execute review workflow
```

**Built-in Validation:**
```markdown
# Template includes validation prompts
## Before Closing Ticket
- [ ] Has progress been documented?
- [ ] Are decisions recorded?
- [ ] Should this trigger follow-up work?
```

**Smart Context Loading:**
```markdown
# Auto-load relevant context
When resuming ticket â†’ Load progress.md + decisions.md
When switching modes â†’ Load previous mode decisions
When starting workflow â†’ Load prerequisites
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 weeks)
1. **Simplify ticket commands**: `memento work`, `memento done`, `memento status`
2. **Add auto-mode detection** to CLAUDE.md template
3. **Improve CLI help** with contextual suggestions
4. **Add interactive setup** for better onboarding

### Phase 2: Smart Features (2-4 weeks)
1. **Git integration** for automatic progress tracking
2. **Workflow chaining** and suggestions
3. **Project analysis** for customized recommendations
4. **Single active ticket** constraint

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (1-2 months)
1. **Editor integrations** (VS Code extension)
2. **Team collaboration** features
3. **Analytics** and productivity insights
4. **Custom workflow generation**

## Success Metrics

### User Experience:
- **Time to productivity**: <2 minutes from `memento init` to productive work
- **Cognitive load**: Reduce CLI commands by 70% for common workflows
- **Adoption**: Increase return usage after initial setup

### LLM Experience:
- **Protocol adherence**: Automatic validation and guidance
- **Context awareness**: Relevant information loaded without manual intervention
- **Workflow completion**: Higher success rate for complex multi-step tasks

## Key Takeaways

1. **Ticket system needs radical simplification** - focus on workflow, not file management
2. **Mode switching should be intelligent** - reduce manual intervention
3. **Workflows need better integration** - chain related procedures automatically
4. **CLI should match mental models** - `work`/`done` vs `create`/`move`/`close`
5. **LLM integration needs improvement** - reduce cognitive load, increase automation

The core vision of Memento Protocol is sound, but the current implementation has too much friction. Focus on reducing ceremony and increasing intelligence to make it truly valuable for both humans and AI assistants.
