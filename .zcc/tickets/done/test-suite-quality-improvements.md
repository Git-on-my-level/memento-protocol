    2. Synchronous help output generation without process spawning
    3. Consistent test execution regardless of environment performance
    4. Maintained all original test assertions for help content validation
  - **Performance Improvement**: Dramatic execution time reduction:
    1. Before: ~7+ seconds (external process spawning)
    2. After: ~0.77 seconds (direct API calls)
    3. 90%+ improvement in test execution speed
  - **Test Reliability**: Eliminated external dependencies and environmental factors:
    1. No longer dependent on npm command availability
    2. No longer affected by CI runner performance variations
    3. No longer requires file system process management
    4. Tests now run consistently across all environments
  - **Full Test Suite**: All 921 tests still pass with no regressions

    2. contracts.test.ts - Converted 2 cache contract tests from real setTimeout delays to fake timers  
    3. edit.test.ts analysis - Determined these were not true timing-dependent tests but async process coordination
  - **Real Timing Dependencies Eliminated**: All setTimeout() calls used for TTL testing now use jest.advanceTimersByTime()
    1. Cache expiration testing (1000ms+ delays) → instant with jest.advanceTimersByTime(1100)
    2. Cache cleanup validation (150ms delays) → instant with jest.advanceTimersByTime(150)
    3. TTL behavior verification → deterministic timing control
  - **Performance Improvement**: TTL tests now run in ~1ms instead of 1000+ ms
  - **Deterministic Testing**: Removed all race conditions from time-based cache behavior tests
  - **Test Results**: All SimpleCache tests (24 tests) and Cache Contract tests (8 tests) pass consistently
  - **Full Test Suite**: All 920+ tests still pass with improved reliability
  - **Impact**: Eliminated timing-dependent test failures by making time-based tests deterministic while preserving all functionality validation
  - **Non-Timing Tests**: Correctly identified that edit.test.ts setTimeout usage is for async coordination, not timing behavior testing

## FuzzyMatcher Test Consolidation Review Results

### Analysis Summary
After reviewing all FuzzyMatcher test files, the consolidation approach is **MOSTLY SAFE** with **performance test preservation concerns**.

### File-by-File Analysis

#### ✅ SAFE TO REMOVE: `fuzzyMatcher-noninteractive.test.ts`
- **Coverage**: Non-interactive mode behavior for auto-selection (94 tests, 216 lines)
- **Duplication**: Significant overlap with main fuzzyMatcher.test.ts:
  - Basic matching functionality (exact, substring, acronym matches) - **100% duplicated**
  - Component data structures and test setup - **100% duplicated**
  - Score validation logic - **90% duplicated**
- **Unique Tests**: Only 6 truly unique tests focused on:
  1. Auto-selection behavior in non-interactive contexts
  2. Score threshold enforcement (80+ for auto-selection)
  3. Ambiguity handling (returning empty when matches too close)
  4. `autoSelectBest` option override behavior
- **Risk Level**: LOW - Unique functionality can be merged as separate describe block

#### ⚠️ REQUIRES CAREFUL HANDLING: `fuzzyMatcher-performance.test.ts`
- **Coverage**: Performance benchmarks across different component set sizes (177 lines)
- **Tests**: 13 performance tests with hardcoded thresholds:
  - Execution time limits: 100ms (exact), 200ms (fuzzy), 150ms (acronym)
  - Memory usage limits: <50MB increase
  - Component set scaling: 100, 500, 1000, 2000 components
- **Unique Value**: **Critical regression detection** - these tests catch:
  - Algorithmic performance regressions
  - Memory leak issues
  - Scaling problems with large component sets
- **CI Fragility Risk**: **HIGH** - Performance tests often fail in CI due to:
  - Variable CI runner performance
  - Resource contention
  - Different hardware capabilities

#### ✅ KEEP: `fuzzyMatcher.test.ts`
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive core functionality testing (286 lines)
- **Quality**: Excellent test organization with clear describe blocks
- **Status**: This is the correct file to keep - comprehensive coverage

### Critical Decision: Performance Tests

**The performance tests provide genuine value** but are inherently fragile in CI environments. **Recommendation**: 

**MODIFY the consolidation approach:**

1. **Move core performance logic to main file**: Extract the performance test structure but with CI-friendly assertions
2. **Replace hard thresholds with relative comparisons**: Instead of `expect(time).toBeLessThan(100)`, use relative performance comparisons
3. **Make thresholds environment-configurable**: Allow CI vs local environment different thresholds
4. **Keep performance monitoring**: These tests have caught real performance regressions

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1a - Preserve Critical Tests:**
1. **Move 6 unique non-interactive tests** to `fuzzyMatcher.test.ts` as new describe block: "Non-interactive mode behavior"
2. **Move performance test structure** to `fuzzyMatcher.test.ts` but with **modified assertions**:
   ```typescript
   // Instead of: expect(executionTimeMs).toBeLessThan(100);
   // Use: expect(executionTimeMs).toBeLessThan(process.env.CI ? 500 : 100);
   ```

**Phase 1b - Safe Removals:**
1. Remove `fuzzyMatcher-noninteractive.test.ts` (after moving unique tests)
2. Remove `fuzzyMatcher-performance.test.ts` (after moving modified performance tests)

### Risk Assessment
- **LOW RISK**: Non-interactive test removal (after preserving unique functionality)
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Performance test removal (requires careful migration of monitoring logic)
- **PERFORMANCE MONITORING IMPACT**: Must preserve regression detection capability

### Revised Impact Estimate
- **Original estimate**: ~50 duplicate test cases removed
- **Revised estimate**: ~44 duplicate test cases removed, 6 unique tests preserved
- **Performance monitoring**: Preserved but made CI-friendly

## Hook System Test Review Results

### Analysis Summary
After reviewing all Hook system test files, the consolidation approach is **MOSTLY SAFE** with some critical tests that need preservation.

### File-by-File Analysis

#### ✅ SAFE TO REMOVE: `HookRegistry.test.ts`
- **Coverage**: Basic registry operations (add, remove, execute, load hooks)
- **Duplication**: All functionality is already tested in `HookManager.test.ts` through high-level operations
- **Risk Level**: LOW - No unique critical functionality

#### ⚠️ PARTIAL REMOVAL: `HookConfigLoader.test.ts`
- **Coverage**: File loading, JSON parsing, error handling, save/delete operations
- **Unique Tests**: Several critical edge cases NOT covered in HookManager.test.ts:
  1. **Invalid JSON handling** (lines 79-98) - Critical for resilience
  2. **Non-JSON file filtering** (lines 43-57) - Security/stability feature
  3. **YAML rejection** (lines 126-134) - Format validation
  4. **Unsupported format handling** (lines 136-144, 184-191) - Error boundaries
  5. **File deletion operations** (lines 194-218) - CRUD completeness

**RECOMMENDATION**: Move these 5 test cases to HookManager.test.ts before removing file.

#### ⚠️ PARTIAL REMOVAL: `HookFileManager.test.ts`  
- **Coverage**: File operations, path safety, script management, timestamped hook cleanup
- **Unique Tests**: Several critical security/cleanup features NOT in HookManager.test.ts:
  1. **Script path safety validation** (lines 60-82) - SECURITY: Prevents deletion of external scripts
  2. **Missing file error handling** (lines 84-99) - Resilience feature
  3. **Multiple timestamped hook cleanup** (lines 242-270) - Bulk operations
  4. **Timestamp pattern detection** (lines 272-293) - Pattern matching logic

**RECOMMENDATION**: Move these 4 test cases to HookManager.test.ts before removing file.

#### ✅ KEEP: `HookManager.test.ts`
- **Coverage**: High-level integration, all major workflows, Claude settings generation
- **Status**: Comprehensive integration testing - this is the right file to keep

### Critical Tests to Preserve

Before removing the files, these **9 specific test cases** must be moved to HookManager.test.ts:

**From HookConfigLoader.test.ts:**
1. Invalid JSON handling with partial success
2. Non-JSON file filtering (.md, .sh files)
3. YAML format rejection
4. Unsupported format error handling
5. File deletion error scenarios

**From HookFileManager.test.ts:**
1. Security check: External script path protection
2. Missing file graceful handling  
3. Multiple timestamped hook processing
4. Non-timestamped hook filtering

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1a**: Move the 9 critical tests to HookManager.test.ts
2. **Phase 1b**: Run full test suite to ensure coverage maintained
3. **Phase 1c**: Remove the two files (HookRegistry.test.ts can go immediately)

### Risk Assessment
- **LOW RISK**: HookRegistry.test.ts removal
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Other removals if critical tests aren't preserved first
- **SECURITY IMPACT**: Must preserve external script path validation test

## Config Test Consolidation Review Results

### Analysis Summary
After reviewing all Config test files, the consolidation approach requires **MODIFICATION** - only partial removal is safe.

### File-by-File Analysis

#### ✅ SAFE TO REMOVE: `config-basic.test.ts`
- **Coverage**: Basic get/set operations with minimal mock verification (2 tests, 82 lines)
- **Duplication**: All functionality is already covered in `config.test.ts` with better test depth
- **Risk Level**: LOW - No unique functionality, completely redundant

#### ⚠️ UNSAFE TO REMOVE: `config-validate.test.ts` 
- **Coverage**: Real file system operations, YAML validation, auto-repair functionality (6 tests, 203 lines)
- **Unique Tests**: **Integration tests** that are NOT covered in unit test files:
  1. **End-to-end validation workflow** - Real YAML parsing and schema validation
  2. **Configuration auto-fixing** - `--fix` flag with actual file repair operations
  3. **Missing file handling** - Graceful error handling for missing config files
  4. **Global config validation** - `--global` flag with real file operations
  5. **Default config creation** - Creating valid config when missing via `--fix`
  6. **Invalid config detection** - Real schema validation failure scenarios

**CRITICAL**: These are **integration tests with real file system operations** that complement the mocked unit tests in other files.

#### ✅ KEEP: `config.test.ts`
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive command-level unit tests with mocks (212 lines)
- **Status**: Excellent coverage of all config subcommands - correct file to keep

#### ✅ KEEP: `configManager.test.ts`  
- **Coverage**: Deep ConfigManager class testing (341 lines)
- **Status**: Comprehensive configuration logic testing - correct file to keep

### Revised Consolidation Strategy

**RECOMMENDED CHANGES TO PHASE 1:**

**Files to remove:**
- ✅ `src/commands/__tests__/config-basic.test.ts` (SAFE - completely redundant)

**Files to KEEP (not remove):**
- ⚠️ `src/commands/__tests__/config-validate.test.ts` (UNSAFE - unique integration tests)
- ✅ `config.test.ts` and `configManager.test.ts` (as planned)

**Impact Adjustment:**
- **Original estimate**: ~25 duplicate test cases removed
- **Revised estimate**: ~2 duplicate test cases removed (from config-basic.test.ts only)
- **Tests preserved**: 6 critical integration tests in config-validate.test.ts

### Risk Assessment
- **LOW RISK**: config-basic.test.ts removal (fully redundant)
- **HIGH RISK**: config-validate.test.ts removal (unique integration coverage)
- **INTEGRATION IMPACT**: Validation tests provide end-to-end coverage that mocks cannot replicate
