## Workflow Execution

### Phase 1: Context & Preparation (5-10 minutes)

#### 1.1 Gather Context
```markdown
**Review Checklist - Context**
- [ ] Read PR description and linked issues
- [ ] Understand the problem being solved
- [ ] Review any design documents or RFCs
- [ ] Check if this is a breaking change
- [ ] Identify affected systems and dependencies
```

#### 1.2 Initial Assessment
- **Change Scope**: How many files, lines of code, and systems affected?
- **Risk Level**: What's the potential impact of bugs in this change?
- **Complexity**: Does this change introduce new patterns or technologies?
- **Test Coverage**: Are there adequate tests for the changes?

#### 1.3 Review Strategy Planning
```javascript
// Example review strategy decision tree
const getReviewStrategy = (changeScope, riskLevel, complexity) => {
  if (riskLevel === 'high' || complexity === 'high') {
    return {
      passes: 4,
      timePerPass: [15, 20, 15, 10], // minutes
      focusAreas: ['security', 'architecture', 'performance', 'testing']
    };
  } else if (changeScope === 'large') {
    return {
      passes: 3,
      timePerPass: [10, 20, 15],
      focusAreas: ['architecture', 'implementation', 'quality']
    };
  } else {
    return {
      passes: 2,
      timePerPass: [15, 15],
      focusAreas: ['implementation', 'quality']
    };
  }
};
```

### Phase 2: Multi-Pass Review

#### Pass 1: Architecture & Design Review (10-15 minutes)

**Focus**: High-level design decisions and system integration

```markdown
**Architecture Checklist**
- [ ] **Design Patterns**: Are appropriate patterns used correctly?
- [ ] **Separation of Concerns**: Are responsibilities clearly separated?
- [ ] **Interface Design**: Are APIs intuitive and well-designed?
- [ ] **Data Flow**: Is data flow clear and efficient?
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Are new dependencies justified and secure?
- [ ] **Backwards Compatibility**: Are breaking changes properly handled?
```

**Key Questions to Ask:**
- Does this solution fit well with the existing architecture?
- Are there simpler ways to achieve the same outcome?
- Will this design scale with expected usage patterns?
- Are error handling and edge cases considered at the design level?

**Common Issues to Flag:**
- Over-engineering or unnecessary complexity
- Tight coupling between unrelated components
- Missing abstraction layers where needed
- Inconsistent patterns with existing codebase

#### Pass 2: Implementation Correctness (15-25 minutes)

**Focus**: Logic correctness, error handling, and functional requirements

```markdown
**Implementation Checklist**
- [ ] **Logic Correctness**: Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Are errors caught and handled appropriately?
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Are boundary conditions and edge cases covered?
- [ ] **Resource Management**: Are resources properly allocated and cleaned up?
- [ ] **Concurrency**: Are race conditions and thread safety considered?
- [ ] **Data Validation**: Is input properly validated and sanitized?
```

**Detailed Code Analysis:**
```python
# Example review considerations for different code patterns

# 1. Error Handling Review
def analyze_error_handling(code_block):
    """
    Check for:
    - Try-catch blocks around risky operations
    - Meaningful error messages
    - Proper error propagation
    - Cleanup in finally blocks
    """
    pass

# 2. Resource Management Review  
def analyze_resource_management(code_block):
    """
    Check for:
    - Proper file/connection closing
    - Memory leak potential
    - Database connection handling
    - Timeout configurations
    """
    pass

# 3. Data Flow Analysis
def analyze_data_flow(code_block):
    """
    Check for:
    - Input validation
    - Data transformation correctness
    - Output sanitization
    - State mutation concerns
    """
    pass
```

**Testing Review:**
- Are unit tests comprehensive and meaningful?
- Do integration tests cover key user journeys?
- Are test names descriptive and test cases realistic?
- Is test data appropriate and not production data?

#### Pass 3: Code Quality & Maintainability (10-20 minutes)

**Focus**: Readability, maintainability, and adherence to standards

```markdown
**Code Quality Checklist**
- [ ] **Readability**: Is the code easy to read and understand?
- [ ] **Naming**: Are variables, functions, and classes well-named?
- [ ] **Comments**: Are comments helpful and not just restating code?
- [ ] **Code Duplication**: Is there unnecessary code duplication?
- [ ] **Function Size**: Are functions appropriately sized and focused?
- [ ] **Complexity**: Is cyclomatic complexity reasonable?
```

**Style & Standards Review:**
```typescript
// Example code quality review points

interface ReviewCriteria {
  // Naming conventions
  variableNames: 'descriptive' | 'abbreviated' | 'unclear';
  functionNames: 'verb-based' | 'descriptive' | 'unclear';
  
  // Structure
  functionLength: 'appropriate' | 'too-long' | 'too-short';
  nestingDepth: number; // Should be <= 3-4 levels
  
  // Documentation
  publicApiDocumented: boolean;
  complexLogicCommented: boolean;
  
  // Maintainability
  codeDuplication: 'none' | 'minor' | 'significant';
  magicNumbers: 'none' | 'some' | 'many';
}
```

**Maintainability Assessment:**
- Will a new developer understand this code in 6 months?
- Are configuration values properly externalized?
- Is the code testable and mockable?
- Are there appropriate abstractions without over-abstraction?

#### Pass 4: Security & Performance (10-15 minutes)

**Focus**: Security vulnerabilities and performance implications

```markdown
**Security Checklist**
- [ ] **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized
- [ ] **Authentication**: Proper auth checks on protected operations
- [ ] **Authorization**: Role-based access controls implemented
- [ ] **Data Exposure**: No sensitive data in logs or responses
- [ ] **Injection Prevention**: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF protections
- [ ] **Cryptography**: Proper encryption and hashing practices
```

**Performance Review:**
```sql
-- Database Query Review Example
-- ❌ Problematic query
SELECT * FROM users u 
JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id 
WHERE u.active = 1;  -- No index on active, SELECT *

-- ✅ Optimized query  
SELECT u.id, u.name, p.title, p.created_at
FROM users u 
JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id 
WHERE u.active = 1   -- Assumes index on (active, id)
LIMIT 50;           -- Pagination
```

**Security Review Focus Areas:**
- Authentication and authorization flows
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error message information disclosure
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Secrets management
- Network security considerations

**Performance Review Focus Areas:**
- Database query efficiency and N+1 problems

## Advanced Review Techniques

### Code Diff Analysis Strategy
```bash
# Use git tools to focus review efficiently
git diff main...feature-branch --name-only | head -10
git diff main...feature-branch --stat
git log main...feature-branch --oneline

# Review commits individually for large changes
git log main...feature-branch --reverse --oneline | while read commit; do
  echo "Reviewing commit: $commit"
  git show $commit
done
```

### Automated Review Support
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions for automated checks
name: Pre-Review Automation
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  automated-checks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Security Scan
        run: npm audit --audit-level=high
      - name: Code Quality
        run: npm run lint && npm run test:coverage
      - name: Performance Budget
        run: npm run build && npm run bundle-analyzer
```

### Review Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Nitpicking Without Purpose**
- ❌ "Use const instead of let here"
- ✅ "Consider const here to prevent accidental reassignment"

**Vague Feedback**
- ❌ "This looks wrong"
- ✅ "This function doesn't handle the case where user is null, which could happen if..."

**Overwhelming Authors**
- ❌ 47 comments on a 10-line change
- ✅ Focus on the most impactful issues first

**Missing the Forest for the Trees**
- ❌ Focusing only on syntax while missing architectural problems
- ✅ Balance detail review with high-level design assessment
