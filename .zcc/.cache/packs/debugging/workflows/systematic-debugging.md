# Systematic Debugging Workflow

A structured, scientific approach to debugging that systematically narrows down problems through hypothesis-driven investigation, ensuring efficient resolution of even the most complex issues.

## Overview

This workflow applies a methodical debugging process based on the scientific method: observe, hypothesize, test, and conclude. It helps developers move beyond random trial-and-error to systematic problem-solving that builds understanding and prevents recurring issues.

## Debugging Philosophy

### Scientific Method Applied
1. **Observe**: Gather comprehensive information about the problem
2. **Hypothesize**: Form testable theories about the root cause  
3. **Test**: Design and execute controlled experiments
4. **Analyze**: Evaluate results and refine understanding
5. **Conclude**: Implement the fix and validate the solution

### Core Principles
- **Reproduce First**: Always establish reliable reproduction steps
- **Isolate Variables**: Change one thing at a time
- **Document Everything**: Keep detailed logs of investigations and findings
- **Think in Systems**: Consider how components interact and affect each other
- **Question Assumptions**: Verify what seems "obviously" correct

## Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `issue_description` | string | ✅ | Clear description of the problem or error |
| `environment` | enum | ✅ | `development`, `staging`, `production`, `local` |
| `urgency` | enum | ❌ | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical` |
| `affected_systems` | array | ❌ | List of systems or components involved |
| `error_logs` | string | ❌ | Relevant error messages or log entries |
| `reproduction_steps` | array | ❌ | Known steps to reproduce the issue |

## Phase 1: Problem Definition & Information Gathering (15-30 minutes)

### 1.1 Issue Documentation Template
```markdown
## Bug Report: [Issue Title]

### Problem Statement
**What is happening?** [Clear, factual description]
**What should be happening?** [Expected behavior]
**Impact**: [Who/what is affected and how]

### Environment Details
- **System**: [OS, browser, device type]
- **Version**: [Application version, commit hash]
- **Configuration**: [Relevant settings, feature flags]
- **Data State**: [Database state, user data, test data]

### Reproduction Information
**Frequency**: Always | Sometimes | Rarely | Once
**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2] 
3. [Observe result]

**Expected Result**: [What should happen]
**Actual Result**: [What actually happens]

### Additional Context
- **Recent Changes**: [Deployments, configuration changes, data updates]
- **Similar Issues**: [Related tickets or patterns]
- **User Reports**: [How users described the problem]
- **Timing**: [When the issue started occurring]
```

### 1.2 Initial Data Collection
```bash
# System state capture checklist
echo "=== System Information ==="
uname -a                    # System info
df -h                      # Disk space
free -h                    # Memory usage
ps aux | grep [app-name]   # Process status

echo "=== Application State ==="
# Application-specific health checks
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health
docker ps                 # Container status  
kubectl get pods          # Kubernetes status (if applicable)

echo "=== Log Analysis ==="
# Collect relevant logs around the time of issue
journalctl -u [service] --since "1 hour ago"
tail -f /var/log/application.log
```

### 1.3 Stakeholder Communication
```markdown
## Initial Status Update Template

**Issue**: [Brief problem description]
**Status**: Investigating
**Priority**: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]
**ETA for Update**: [Next communication timeline]

**What we know**:
- [Key facts discovered so far]
- [Impact assessment]
- [Immediate mitigation steps taken]

**Next steps**:
- [Investigation plan]
- [Timeline for resolution attempt]

**How to help**: [What stakeholders can provide if anything]
```

## Phase 2: Problem Isolation & Hypothesis Formation (20-45 minutes)

### 2.1 Systematic Isolation Strategy

#### Binary Search Debugging
```python
# Conceptual approach to isolating the problem space
def binary_search_debugging(problem_space):
    """
    Divide the problem space in half and test each side
    to quickly narrow down the location of the issue
    """
    if len(problem_space) <= 1:
        return problem_space[0]  # Found the issue
    
    mid = len(problem_space) // 2
    first_half = problem_space[:mid]
    second_half = problem_space[mid:]
    
    # Test first half
    if test_configuration(first_half):
        return binary_search_debugging(second_half)
    else:
        return binary_search_debugging(first_half)

# Example applications:
# - Time range: when did the issue start?
# - Code changes: which commit introduced the bug?
# - Data range: which records are affected?
# - User segments: which users experience the issue?
```

#### Component Isolation Matrix
```markdown
| Component | Working? | Evidence | Next Test |
|-----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Database | ✅ | Queries returning expected data | - |
| API Layer | ❓ | Some endpoints slow | Test individual endpoints |
| Frontend | ❌ | Users reporting errors | Isolate specific components |
| Cache | ❓ | Hit rates seem low | Check cache configuration |
| Network | ✅ | No packet loss observed | - |
```

### 2.2 Hypothesis Generation Framework

#### The 5 Whys Technique
```markdown
**Problem**: Users can't login to the application

**Why 1**: Why can't users login?
→ The authentication service is returning 500 errors

**Why 2**: Why is the auth service returning 500 errors?
→ Database queries are timing out

**Why 3**: Why are database queries timing out?
→ Database CPU usage is at 100%

**Why 4**: Why is database CPU usage at 100%?
→ A batch job is running during peak hours

**Why 5**: Why is the batch job running during peak hours?
→ The scheduled time was changed but monitoring wasn't updated

**Root Cause**: Batch job scheduling conflict with peak usage
```

#### Hypothesis Ranking Template
```markdown
## Potential Root Causes (Ranked by Likelihood)

### High Probability (>60%)
1. **Database Connection Pool Exhaustion**
   - **Evidence**: Connection errors in logs, high concurrent users
   - **Test**: Monitor connection pool metrics, check pool size config
   - **Time to Test**: 15 minutes

2. **Memory Leak in User Session Handler**
   - **Evidence**: Memory usage increasing over time, session-related errors
   - **Test**: Profile memory usage, check session cleanup logic
   - **Time to Test**: 30 minutes

### Medium Probability (20-60%)
3. **Configuration Drift in Load Balancer**
   - **Evidence**: Some users affected more than others
   - **Test**: Check load balancer logs and configuration
   - **Time to Test**: 20 minutes

### Low Probability (<20%)
4. **Network Infrastructure Issues**
   - **Evidence**: Intermittent nature, no clear pattern
   - **Test**: Network latency and packet loss analysis
   - **Time to Test**: 45 minutes
```

## Phase 3: Controlled Testing & Evidence Gathering (30-60 minutes)

### 3.1 Test Design Principles

#### Controlled Experiment Framework
```javascript
// Example test framework for systematic debugging
class DebugTest {
  constructor(hypothesis, testMethod, expectedOutcome) {
    this.hypothesis = hypothesis;
    this.testMethod = testMethod;
    this.expectedOutcome = expectedOutcome;
    this.results = null;
  }

  async execute() {
    console.log(`Testing: ${this.hypothesis}`);
    
    // Capture baseline state
    const baseline = await this.captureState();
    
    try {
      // Execute test
      const result = await this.testMethod();
      this.results = {
        success: true,
        data: result,
        baseline: baseline
      };
    } catch (error) {
      this.results = {
        success: false,
        error: error,
        baseline: baseline
      };
    }
    
    // Evaluate against expected outcome
    return this.evaluateResults();
  }

  evaluateResults() {
    const outcome = this.results.success ? 'PASS' : 'FAIL';
    const evidence = this.results.success ? this.results.data : this.results.error;
    
    return {
      hypothesis: this.hypothesis,
      outcome: outcome,
      evidence: evidence,
      conclusion: this.drawConclusion(outcome, evidence)
    };
  }
}

// Usage example
const connectionPoolTest = new DebugTest(
  "Database connection pool is exhausted",
  async () => {
    // Test by monitoring connection pool under load
    const poolStats = await database.getPoolStats();
    return poolStats;
  },
  "Pool usage should be < 80%"
);
```

### 3.2 Evidence Collection Strategies

#### Application-Level Debugging
```python
# Systematic logging for evidence collection
import logging
import time
import psutil
from functools import wraps

def debug_trace(func):
    """Decorator to trace function execution for debugging"""
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        memory_before = psutil.virtual_memory().used
        
        logging.debug(f"Entering {func.__name__} with args: {args[:3]}...")  # Truncate sensitive data
        
        try:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            execution_time = time.time() - start_time
            memory_after = psutil.virtual_memory().used
            
            logging.debug(f"Exiting {func.__name__}: time={execution_time:.3f}s, "
                         f"memory_delta={memory_after - memory_before}bytes")
            return result
            
        except Exception as e:
            execution_time = time.time() - start_time
            logging.error(f"Exception in {func.__name__}: {str(e)}, time={execution_time:.3f}s")
            raise
    
    return wrapper

# Usage in suspected problematic functions
@debug_trace
def process_user_request(user_id, request_data):
    # Function implementation
    pass
```

#### Database Investigation Queries
```sql
-- Performance analysis queries
-- Check for long-running queries
SELECT pid, now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start AS duration, query 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE (now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start) > interval '5 minutes';

-- Check for blocking queries
SELECT blocked_locks.pid AS blocked_pid,
       blocked_activity.usename AS blocked_user,
       blocking_locks.pid AS blocking_pid,
       blocking_activity.usename AS blocking_user,
       blocked_activity.query AS blocked_statement,
       blocking_activity.query AS current_statement_in_blocking_process
FROM pg_catalog.pg_locks blocked_locks
JOIN pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity blocked_activity ON blocked_activity.pid = blocked_locks.pid
JOIN pg_catalog.pg_locks blocking_locks ON blocking_locks.locktype = blocked_locks.locktype
JOIN pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity blocking_activity ON blocking_activity.pid = blocking_locks.pid
WHERE NOT blocked_locks.GRANTED;

-- Check connection pool status
SELECT count(*) as total_connections,
       count(*) FILTER (WHERE state = 'active') as active_connections,
       count(*) FILTER (WHERE state = 'idle') as idle_connections
FROM pg_stat_activity;
```

### 3.3 Real-Time Debugging Techniques

#### Live System Analysis
```bash
# Real-time monitoring while reproducing the issue
# Terminal 1: Monitor system resources
watch -n 1 'top -bn1 | head -20'

# Terminal 2: Monitor application logs
tail -f /var/log/application.log | grep -i error

# Terminal 3: Monitor network connections
watch -n 2 'netstat -an | grep :8080 | wc -l'

# Terminal 4: Execute reproduction steps
curl -v http://localhost:8080/problematic-endpoint

# Terminal 5: Monitor database
while true; do
  psql -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state='active';"
  sleep 5;
done
```

## Phase 4: Root Cause Analysis & Solution Design (20-40 minutes)

### 4.1 Evidence Synthesis Matrix

```markdown
## Evidence Analysis

| Hypothesis | Supporting Evidence | Contradicting Evidence | Confidence Level |
|------------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| DB Pool Exhaustion | ✅ Pool at 95% capacity<br/>✅ Connection timeout errors | ❌ Issue occurs during low-traffic periods | Medium (70%) |
| Memory Leak | ✅ Memory usage climbing<br/>✅ Performance degrades over time | ❌ Restart doesn't immediately fix issue | Low (30%) |
| Config Drift | ✅ Recent deployment<br/>✅ Environment differences | ❌ Issue reproducible locally | High (85%) |

**Conclusion**: Configuration drift is most likely cause
```

```

### 4.3 Solution Design Principles

#### Immediate vs. Long-term Solutions
```markdown
## Solution Strategy

### Immediate Mitigation (< 30 minutes)
1. **Increase database connection pool size** 
   - Risk: May mask underlying inefficiency
   - Benefit: Immediate relief for users
   - Rollback: Easy configuration change

2. **Implement circuit breaker pattern**
   - Risk: Some features may be unavailable
   - Benefit: Prevents cascade failures
   - Rollback: Feature flag toggle

### Short-term Fix (< 2 hours)
1. **Optimize database query patterns**
   - Add proper indexing for new queries
   - Implement connection pooling best practices
   - Add query performance monitoring

### Long-term Solution (< 1 week)  
1. **Implement comprehensive performance testing**
   - Add load testing to CI/CD pipeline
   - Create performance benchmarks
   - Add automated alerting for degradation
```

## Phase 5: Solution Implementation & Validation (30-90 minutes)

### 5.1 Incremental Fix Strategy

```python
# Example: Implementing circuit breaker pattern for debugging
import time
import logging
from enum import Enum

class CircuitState(Enum):
    CLOSED = "closed"      # Normal operation
    OPEN = "open"          # Failing, reject requests
    HALF_OPEN = "half_open"  # Testing recovery

class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, recovery_timeout=60):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.recovery_timeout = recovery_timeout
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.state = CircuitState.CLOSED
    
    def call(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.state == CircuitState.OPEN:
            if time.time() - self.last_failure_time > self.recovery_timeout:
                self.state = CircuitState.HALF_OPEN
                logging.info("Circuit breaker: Attempting recovery")
            else:
                raise Exception("Circuit breaker OPEN - request rejected")
        
        try:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            if self.state == CircuitState.HALF_OPEN:
                self.state = CircuitState.CLOSED
                self.failure_count = 0
                logging.info("Circuit breaker: Recovery successful")
            return result
            
        except Exception as e:
            self.failure_count += 1
            self.last_failure_time = time.time()
            
            if self.failure_count >= self.failure_threshold:
                self.state = CircuitState.OPEN
                logging.error("Circuit breaker OPEN - too many failures")
            
            raise e

# Usage for debugging problematic database calls
db_circuit_breaker = CircuitBreaker(failure_threshold=3, recovery_timeout=30)

def get_user_data(user_id):
    return db_circuit_breaker.call(database.get_user, user_id)
```

    # Trigger rollback if needed
  else
    echo "✅ System healthy"
  fi
  
  sleep 60  # Wait 1 minute
done
```

### 6.2 Knowledge Base Updates

```markdown
# Debugging Runbook Entry: Database Connection Issues

## Quick Diagnosis
```bash
# Check connection pool status
psql -c "SELECT count(*) as connections, state FROM pg_stat_activity GROUP BY state;"

# Check for connection errors in logs
grep -i "connection" /var/log/application.log | tail -20

# Monitor real-time connections
watch -n 5 'psql -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state='\''active'\'';"'
```

## Common Symptoms
- Timeouts during database operations
- "Connection pool exhausted" errors
- Slow response times for database-heavy operations
- 500 errors on endpoints that require database access

## Investigation Steps
1. Check connection pool configuration vs. actual usage
2. Look for long-running queries blocking connections
3. Verify database server capacity and performance
4. Check for connection leaks in application code

## Solutions
- **Immediate**: Increase pool size temporarily
- **Short-term**: Optimize queries and fix connection leaks  
- **Long-term**: Implement connection pooling best practices

## Prevention
- Monitor connection pool metrics
- Set up alerts for high connection usage
- Implement proper connection lifecycle management
- Regular connection pool tuning based on load patterns
```

from jaeger_client import Config

def init_tracer(service_name):

### Performance Debugging

```python
# Systematic performance profiling for debugging
import cProfile
import pstats
import io
from functools import wraps

def profile_performance(func):
    """Decorator to profile function performance for debugging"""
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        pr = cProfile.Profile()
        pr.enable()
        
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        
        pr.disable()
        s = io.StringIO()
        ps = pstats.Stats(pr, stream=s).sort_stats('cumulative')
        ps.print_stats()
        
        # Log performance data for analysis
        logging.debug(f"Performance profile for {func.__name__}:\n{s.getvalue()}")
        
        return result
    return wrapper

# Usage on suspected performance bottlenecks
@profile_performance
def process_large_dataset(data):
    # Implementation that might be slow
    pass
```

Remember: Systematic debugging is about applying scientific rigor to problem-solving. The goal is not just to fix the immediate issue, but to understand why it happened and prevent similar issues in the future. Stay methodical, document everything, and always validate your solutions.
