# Community Repository Plan

## Vision

Create an "awesome-memento" style community repository for sharing modes, workflows, and agents across the zcc ecosystem. This would function similarly to awesome-zsh-plugins, providing a curated collection of community-contributed components.

## Objectives

- Enable community sharing of custom modes, workflows, and agents
- Provide discovery mechanism for high-quality components
- Establish quality standards and contribution guidelines
- Foster ecosystem growth and collaboration

## Component Categories

### Modes
- **Development**: Engineering, debugging, architecture roles
- **Writing**: Technical writing, documentation, content creation
- **Research**: Analysis, investigation, learning assistance
- **Specialized**: Domain-specific expertise (security, performance, etc.)

### Workflows
- **Code Review**: PR review, code quality assessment
- **Debugging**: Systematic debugging approaches
- **Testing**: Test strategy, coverage analysis
- **Deployment**: Release procedures, rollback workflows

### Agents
- **Language-Specific**: Python, JavaScript, Rust, Go specialized agents
- **Tool Integration**: Git, Docker, Kubernetes, cloud platform agents
- **Framework-Specific**: React, Django, Spring Boot agents

### Starter Packs
- **Frontend**: React, Vue, Angular development setups
- **Backend**: API development, microservices, databases
- **DevOps**: CI/CD, infrastructure, monitoring
- **AI/ML**: Data science, machine learning, model development

## Quality Standards

### Component Requirements
1. **Documentation**: Clear description, usage examples, prerequisites
2. **Metadata**: Proper frontmatter with author, version, tags
3. **Testing**: Include example usage and expected outcomes
4. **Maintenance**: Active maintenance commitment from contributors

### Review Process
1. **Submission**: PR with component and documentation
2. **Review**: Community review for quality and usefulness
3. **Testing**: Verification of component functionality
4. **Approval**: Merge after maintainer approval

## Contribution Guidelines

### For Contributors
- Follow component template structure
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Provide usage examples
- Test thoroughly before submission
- Maintain components after contribution

### For Maintainers
- Review submissions for quality and standards
- Ensure proper categorization
- Test components before approval
- Maintain overall repository organization

## Installation Integration

### Future zcc Integration
```bash
# Install from community repo
zcc add mode community/advanced-debugging
zcc add workflow community/comprehensive-review
zcc add agent community/rust-expert

# Browse available components
zcc browse community

# Search community components
zcc search "react testing"
```

### Component Format
Components should follow existing zcc template format with additional metadata:

```yaml
---
name: advanced-debugging
description: Comprehensive debugging assistant with systematic approach
author: community-contributor
version: 1.0.0
tags: [debugging, troubleshooting, systematic]
repository: https://github.com/contributor/zcc-components
license: MIT
tested-with: ["zcc@1.0.0"]
---
```

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Future)
- Create awesome-zcc repository
- Establish basic structure and guidelines
- Seed with high-quality examples
- Set up contribution process

### Phase 2: Integration (Future)
- Add community browsing to zcc CLI
- Implement remote installation
- Add search and discovery features
- Create component validation tools

### Phase 3: Ecosystem (Future)
- Community moderation tools
- Component rating/feedback system
- Automated testing pipeline
- Integration with zcc package manager

## Success Metrics

- Number of quality components contributed
- Community engagement and adoption
- Integration usage statistics
- Ecosystem diversity and coverage

## Notes

This is a long-term vision document. Implementation should begin only after:
1. zcc has sufficient user adoption
2. Core functionality is stable
3. Community interest is demonstrated
4. Maintenance resources are available

The focus should be on organic growth and quality over quantity.
