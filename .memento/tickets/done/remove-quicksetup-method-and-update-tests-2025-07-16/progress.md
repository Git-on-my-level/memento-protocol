# Ticket: Remove quickSetup method and update tests

## Description
The quickSetup method in InteractiveSetup class is no longer used after removing the --quick CLI option. This technical debt should be cleaned up by:
1. Remove the quickSetup method from src/lib/interactiveSetup.ts
2. Remove all related tests from src/lib/__tests__/interactiveSetup.test.ts
3. Remove any references in src/commands/__tests__/init.test.ts
4. Ensure all tests still pass after removal
